<p style="color:black; font-size:16px";> Docker is a tool
    designed to make it easier to create, deploy,
    and run applications by using containers. Containers
    allow a developer to package up an application with
    all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other
    dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so,
    thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that
    the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless
    of any customized settings that machine might have that could
    differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code. </p>

<p style="color:black; font-size:16px";> In a way,
    Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike
    a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual
    operating system, Docker allows applications to use the
    same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on
    and only requires applications be shipped with things not
    already running on the host computer. This gives a significant
    performance boost and reduces the size of the application. </p>

<p style="color:black; font-size:16px";> And importantly,
    Docker is open source. This means that anyone can
    contribute to Docker and extend it to meet their own
    needs if they need additional features that aren't
    available out of the box. </p>

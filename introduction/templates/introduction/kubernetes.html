<h3 align="center"> Kubernetes </h3>

<p style="color:black; font-size:16px";> Kubernetes is a portable,
    extensible open-source platform for managing
    containerized workloads and services, that facilitates
    both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large,
    rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and
    tools are widely available. </p>

<p style="color:black; font-size:16px";> Kubernetes provides a <b>container-centric</b>
    management environment. It orchestrates computing,
    networking, and storage infrastructure on behalf
    of user workloads. This provides much of the simplicity
    of Platform as a Service (PaaS) with the flexibility of
    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and enables portability
    across infrastructure providers. </p>
